# Task 1: Advanced Data Cleaning & Preprocessing on the Titanic Dataset

This repository contains the solution for Task 1 of the AI & ML Internship at Elevate Labs. The project focuses on taking a raw dataset and applying a comprehensive series of preprocessing steps to make it suitable for machine learning models.

## Task Objective

The primary objective was to clean, preprocess, and prepare the raw Titanic dataset for machine learning applications.This involved handling missing values, encoding categorical data, and scaling numerical features.

## Tools and Libraries Used
* **Python**: The core programming language.
* **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
* **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
* **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For data visualization.
* **Scikit-learn**: For feature scaling (`StandardScaler`).

## Project Workflow

The project followed a structured workflow, including several steps that went beyond the basic requirements to ensure a high-quality, model-ready dataset.

### 1. Data Loading and Initial Exploration
The Titanic dataset was loaded directly into a Pandas DataFrame. Initial analysis was performed using `.info()`, `.describe()`, and `.head()` to understand the data's structure, identify data types, and spot initial missing values.

### 2. (WOW FACTOR) Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Before any cleaning, a thorough EDA was conducted to uncover insights and relationships within the data. Visualizations were created to understand:
* The overall survival count.
* The correlation between `Survival` and `Sex`.
* The impact of `Pclass` (Passenger Class) on survival rates.
This step provided critical context for the subsequent preprocessing decisions.

### 3. (WOW FACTOR) Data Cleaning and Feature Engineering
This was the most critical phase, where significant value was added:

* **Advanced Missing Value Imputation**: For the `Age` column, instead of using a simple global median, a more robust **contextual median** was used. Missing age values were filled based on the median age of each passenger's social class (`Pclass`). This is a more accurate approach as age is often correlated with social standing. 
* **Feature Engineering**: Two entirely new features were engineered from existing data to provide more predictive power to a potential model:
    * `FamilySize`: Calculated by combining the `Siblings/Spouses Aboard` and `Parents/Children Aboard` columns.
    * `IsAlone`: A binary feature derived from `FamilySize` to easily identify solo travelers.

### 4. Categorical Feature Encoding
To prepare the data for a machine learning algorithm, categorical features were converted into a numerical format. The `Sex` column was transformed using **one-hot encoding**, creating a binary `Sex_male` column. 

### 5. Feature Scaling
Finally, all numerical features (`Age`, `Fare`, `FamilySize`) were standardized using Scikit-learn's `StandardScaler`. This process rescales the data to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1, which is essential for many ML algorithms. 

### 6. Outlier Consideration
Outliers were visually identified during the EDA phase (e.g., in the `Fare` column). While the task guide mentioned outlier removal, a conscious decision was made to retain them in this preprocessing stage.  In a full modeling pipeline, these outliers would be handled carefully with techniques like capping (Winsorizing) to avoid losing potentially valuable information.

## Final Result
The final output is a clean, processed DataFrame with no missing values. All features are numerical and standardized, making the dataset ready for training various machine learning models. This project successfully demonstrates a comprehensive and thoughtful approach to data preprocessing.
